    <p class="saving-info">A savings account is an interest-bearing deposit account held at a bank or other financial institution. Though these accounts typically pay a modest interest rate, their safety and reliability make them a great option for parking cash you want available for short-term needs. Banks offer savings accounts to their customers as a complement to their checking accounts. It is a good place for people to put their cash for a short period of time for very short-term needs such as home renovations, vacations, cars, or emergencies like medical or dental bills.
    Banks make building a savings account balance fairly easy. The account can be added to a debit card to make deposits as well as withdrawals, transfers through online banking, and wire payments directly into the account from other institutions.

<p class="checking-info">A checking account is a deposit account held at a financial institution that allows withdrawals and deposits. Also called demand accounts or transactional accounts, checking accounts are very liquid and can be accessed using checks, automated teller machines, and electronic debits, among other methods. A checking account differs from other bank accounts in that it often allows for numerous withdrawals and unlimited deposits, whereas savings accounts sometimes limit both.
