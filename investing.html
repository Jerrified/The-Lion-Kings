  <p>Partial ownership in a company. Shareholders are entitled to the profits of the company and are responsible for their own risk for the part of the company that each share represents. There are two main types of stocks: common stock and preferred stock. Owners of common stock have the right to vote on important company decisions, such as whether to merge with another company and receive dividends determined by the board of directors. Owners of preferred shares generally do not have voting rights, but receive minimal dividends. Stocks can be bought or sold, often, but not always, on a stock exchange. It is important to note that a share of common stock represents only a small amount of ownership and therefore most stocks are traded in lots of 100.</p>

  <p>A bond is a debt and is issued over one year. US governments, local governments, counties, businesses, and many other types of organizations sell bonds. When an investor buys bonds, he is lending money. The bond seller agrees to repay the principal of the loan at a specific time. Interest-bearing bonds pay interest periodically</p>

  <p>The stock market can be a physical place, sometimes called a stock exchange, where brokers come together to buy and sell stocks and other securities. This term is also used more broadly to include electronic transactions that take place over computer and telephone lines. In fact, in many markets around the world, all securities transactions are processed electronically.</p>
    <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/dividend.asp">Dividends</a>
  <p>Part of a listed company or income from funds distributed to shareholders. The amount of profit divided as dividends is usually determined by the board and divided by the number of shares, but preferred shares usually have a guaranteed dividend. Dividends exist to encourage investment in the business and allow shareholders to share in the profits. A rapidly growing business often pays little or no dividends, as most of its income is reinvested in the business. In contrast, a well-established company with solid profitability is likely to pay a relatively high dividend.</p>
